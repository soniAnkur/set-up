HTML as a declarative UI
Data Models (also called scopes) are just simple JavaScript objects
Property found on the scope are automatically data bound to the view and are watched for changes
Directives allow us to invent our own HTML elements (accordion, grid)
All DOM manipulation is put into directives separating them from the MVC app
Filters restructure/format the data before they reach the view (formatting decimal places, filtering an array based on a parameter, pagination); similar to directives in the sense that they are stand-alone functions separate from your app, but are concerned only with data transformations rather than DOM manipulation
DOM manipulations and service calls are separate, finally!
Controllers are light-weight, Services should do all the heavy lifting
Unit and E2E testing ready - DI and mock HTTP provider

<DIV>
Teaches the browser new syntax through a construct we call directives. Examples include:
* Data binding, as in {{}}.
* DOM control structures for repeating/hiding DOM fragments.
* Support for forms and form validation.
* Attaching code-behind to DOM elements.
* Grouping of HTML into reusable components.
